  Aura farming refers to a behavior (often in reference to an anime character) where a person basically does something for the sake of looking cool or “giving off presence.” “Aura” is also its own meme which basically means the quality that a person emanates their presence similar to how aura in anime describes an energy visibly emanating off characters. When someone with “aura” is in the room, you know it, and they’re the focus of attention. When a character with “aura” enters a scene, they dominate it. “Aura farming” is any action where someone is doing something that accumulates aura.

Aura farming moments can be especially humorous when the moment does NOT call for it realistically. Like imagine a villain shows up right before the protagonist reaches his goal, perched atop a high platform, cape flowing in the wind as a massive thunderbolt cracks across the twilit sky behind him. Cool as fuck, right? That guy has aura. But from a practicality standpoint, why wouldn’t he use the advantage of surprise to sneak attack the protagonist instead of making an aura entrance? Bro was aura farming.

Changing your profile picture to Clippy is a fun way to express frustration with the exploitative nature of technology. It's an easy way to participate and feel part of a larger movement. According to Rossmann, cultural change is the first step toward policy change.
