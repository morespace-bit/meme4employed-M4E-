    "What is aura farming. If you’ve been on TikTok, Instagram, or even in meme comment sections lately, you’ve probably seen people accusing someone of “aura farming.",
  longDes: `
    Aura farming is when someone deliberately acts in a way that makes them look cool or “give off presence,” often at the expense of practicality. The term comes from anime, where “aura” is the visible energy characters project. Think of a villain making a dramatic, slow entrance instead of using the element of surprise  that’s aura farming.
